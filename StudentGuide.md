# Integrating with NetSuite Using ICS Workshop Prerequisites

## 3rd Party Testing Tools

### Install Postman

We will use Postman to test an ICS REST Web Service integration.

If you don't already have Postman installed on your workstation, you'll need to install it.

To install Postman for testing the ICS integration follow these instructions:

- Download the Postman OpenSource application for your desktop/laptop from the URL: <https://www.getpostman.com/>
